Metronome-Swift
===============

A simple metronome application built in Swift.

My intentions & goals of this application were to:

1. write my first application in Swift;
2. understand how NSTimer can be applied to a metronome; and
3. build a basic foundation for a side-project.

Future plans for this app are:

* improving the metronome's accuracy
* cleaning up the GUI
* expanding the functionality and scope
  * Although this is very vague, I don't want to give away what my plans are as of yet ;)
